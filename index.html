                <p>Taiki Waititi once again puts a fantastic spin on the superhero genre in Love & Thunder. Many may
                    feel as if this movie has too many jokes, but they are very well-balanced against the more heartfelt
                    moments with the movie stops and reflects. Waititi does a great job in evolving Chris Hemsworth's
                    character. Thor has experienced so much loss in his life and is afraid to open up, but by the time
                    the credits roll, we see a Thor who is much more open to love not in spite of but because of that
                    loss.

                    <br>
                    Speaking of Chris Hemsworth, she once again does a fabulous job with his character, and while he may
                    seem a little bit egotistical throughout the first and second acts of the movie, knowing what he's
                    gone through does give him an understanding and justification from my point of view. Natalie Portman
                    as Jane Foster also put in a fantastic performance and reminds viewers exactly why she should be in
                    the MCU.

                <p>
                    Now I hardly get overly emotional over films, but this one had me in my feelings by the end of it…
                    The fact that all three Spider-Men that I grew up watching were all in the same film is extremely
                    cool!!!!!!
                    I am glad that I was able to experience that in the same room with so many other people!!!!!!
                    It’s definitely a moment I will never forget!
                    My screening was almost packed and for the first time ever, people actually cheered!!!!!!!
                    I’m from the UK and that is NOT a common thing like it is in the US…
                    Not everyone cheered unfortunately but it was enough for me to realise just how important these
                    characters mean to some people…including me!!!!!!!
                    As soon as Andrew Garfield came through that portal, people went crazy!!!!!!!!!!

                    <br>
                    Spider-Man No Way Home is absolutely breathtaking!!!!!!
                    Believe the hype and go and experience this once in a lifetime cinematic experience!!!!!!!
                    Spider-Man No Way Home delivers on everything that I wanted to see and so much more too!!!!!
                    This is honestly one of my favourite films of all time!
                    It might even be my favourite Spider-Man film too…
                    Tom Holland really gives it his all in this film to be honest!
                    He gives by far his most emotional performance yet as the famous Web-head!
                    By the end of the film he really does become that iconic Spider-Man that we all know and love…
                    I love how the film goes back to the traditional Spider-Man; living by himself, listening to police
                    radios, designing his own suit by hand and then eventually swinging around New York.

                    Jon Spaihts, Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill have written the film very well. the journey of
                    the main character is shown in a nice way, from an accident, Stephen Strange, a famous neurosurgeon,
                    loses the ability to use his hands, so he goes to visit the mysterious Ancient One to heal himself
                    and becomes a great sorcerer. The Cinematography of the film is perfect! The cinematographer, or
                    director of photography, is the key creative head tasked with translating the director’s vision to
                    the actual film or digital
                    recording.

                    Despite the grandiosity of Doctor Strange's story and action scenes, the mid-credits scene in the
                    latest MCU adventure shows a surprising amount of restraint by simply showing a conversation between
                    Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Strange over some magic beers.
